This model is created in the Sketchup program. The sketchup supports the export of .max, .obj and 3DS files, if you do not have enough knowledge to optimize the models for your program, you will get an average result of the visual quality of the render.

Render is made in v-ray 2.0. Materials are configured only for Sketchup !!!

To ensure that the material settings in the Sketchup are fully displayed, you need to add reflection maps and a bump map. Do this as shown in pictures 1 and 2. Add maps with according to the name of the texture.
I want to note, this is low poly model, but with skillful handling it is possible to achieve a good result.
